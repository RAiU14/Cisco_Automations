# Cisco_Automations
A set of python program files which can be used smartly and efficiently to make things easier! 

>**Cisco_EOX.py**  
> A web-scrapping python program to gather EOX details about a device if product/model number of the device is passed as an input.
> Output is not stored anywhere, just displayed. (As of now)
[Needs fixing!]

>**Connection.py**
> Has the necessary snippet to connect to the network to run the netmiko commands.

>**Log_Capture.py**  
> Gather logs from a cisco switches (devices) in bulk amount, by passing the IP Address and the required show commands.
> The logs files will be saved by the device hostname.

>**NX_OS.py**
> Created to analyse and output the logs to excel sheet for quick understanding and reference. It works in one or multiple files with some constraints. 
[WIP]

>**Ping_Checks.py**
> Performing a ping test from the jump host to check if the device is connected to the network.

[Requirement files will be added later!]
